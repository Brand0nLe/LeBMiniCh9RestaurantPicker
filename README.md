# Mini Challenge 9 - Restaurant Picker
# This project will give the user 4 different array choices. Asian food, Fast food, Beverages, and a randomizer option. There are 10 options in each array for a total of 30 options when the user decides to use the help function to target a random integer from the randomizer array. There is a play again function and error messages for when the user input is invalid for choosing their options.
