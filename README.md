# Mini Challenge 9 - Restaurant Picker
# This project will give the user 4 different array choices. Asian food, Fast food, Beverages, and a randomizer option. There are 10 options in each array for a total of 30 options when the user decides to use the help function to target a random integer from the randomizer array. There is a play again function and error messages for when the user input is not ONE, TWO, THREE, or HELP.

I really liked how Brandon did his code. It is organized well and is easy to read. I liked how when he did his Console.WriteLine()'s he made almost boxes around what he was saying to the user, really interesting. If there was one thing to nitpick it was that when you type a number bigger than the options given to you it throws an error but other than that I really liked it. Good Job Brandon! :)
